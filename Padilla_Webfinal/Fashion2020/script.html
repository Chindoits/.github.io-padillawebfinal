    Good afternoon everyone, my name is Katia Padilla and I’m here to present my Spring 2020 trend on: Catch me Outside, Anytime Anywear; Flexibility is the New Fashion. 

This trend is inspired by current shifts within the active trends of millennial fashion. 

Let’s walk among today’s concrete jungle of fashion through city sidewalks, coffee shops, and start-ups. 

The soft tones of Anytime Peach and Sandy Catch are welcoming. The boldness of Cali-red will start-up ideas and enhance creativity. Colors like Outside Blues and Blue Lake are the cornerstone of the everyday millennial in today’s ever-changing world.

In this fast paced city life we see materials with flexible fibers such as polyester and mesh, as well as popular textiles like cotton and denim.

For apparel, the use of baggy and free flowing features are profiled. We find denim and cotton pieces interchangeable. It is adaptable between the active and casual lifestyle. Mesh makes it way in upper body wear and utilized throughout many environments.

For accessories, we see everyday staples like fitted watches and sunglasses that leave a bold statement. Taking the right step forward with comfort in mind, we see a “chunk” of the past make a come back in active or casual footwear. 

The colors of Spring find its way home in upholstery and comforting aesthetics. We see creamy colors and relaxing blue hues to soothe the busy mind. The pops of orange and red give the home a flare.

We see natural skin tones and soft hues spring their way in Cosmetics. The natural look is back along with glossy lips, moreover , the use of burnt reds and oranges remind us that the fruit of our labors will pay off and give way to the next season.

“Catch me Outside” is the trend that portrays the active and chill side of the everyday millennial. The changing of technology and social standards is embraced through fashion and moves along the seasons.
